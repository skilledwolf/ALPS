# Export an ALPS simulation with nanobind

This example replaces the former Boost.Python export tutorial while retaining the public `ALPS_EXPORT_SIM_TO_PYTHON` helper. Build it against an installed ALPS SDK and the Python environment containing pyalps and nanobind:

Use GIL-enabled CPython 3.10 or newer and nanobind 2.15.0. Build this example with the same interpreter as the installed pyalps package. Both use the ordinary CPython ABI; the CMake package checks nanobind's internals ABI before linking.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -GNinja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DALPS_DIR=/path/to/alps/share/alps \
  -DPython_EXECUTABLE="$(command -v python)"
cmake --build build
PYTHONPATH="$PWD/build" python main.py
```

For an old export source, include `<pyalps/export_simulation.hpp>` in place of `<alps/ngs/detail/export_sim_to_python.hpp>` and replace `BOOST_PYTHON_MODULE(name) {` with `NB_MODULE(name, m) {`; the existing `ALPS_EXPORT_SIM_TO_PYTHON(PythonName, SimulationClass)` call remains valid. The helper imports pyalps' owning extension modules before registering the derived class, so ALPS parameter, archive, observable, and result types are shared safely through nanobind's process-wide type registry. The example also discovers the CMake package shipped by pyalps and links `pyalps::runtime` to use the exact `libalps`, Boost, and HDF5 copies carried by a repaired pyalps wheel. This is required for stateful library objects such as HDF5 handles; do not replace it with a second system HDF5 linkage.
