## Imports the compiled extensions from pyalps._ext and re-exports them, both
## as attributes of pyalps.cxx and as pyalps.cxx.<name> module entries.
##
## The historic second half of this file caught ImportError and retried the
## same names as top-level modules, for the old in-tree build where every .so
## sat side by side on PYTHONPATH. No installed layout can satisfy that spelling,
## so the fallback could only ever mask a genuine import failure.

# The compiled extensions, in the order pyalps.cxx exposes them.
