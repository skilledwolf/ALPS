## Reporting bugs and requesting features

Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ALPSim/ALPS/issues) before opening an issue. For a bug, include your ALPS commit or version, OS and architecture, compiler and dependency versions, exact commands, the error output, and a small reproducer. For incorrect simulation results, include the input parameters, expected result and its reference, and any relevant random seed.

Small fixes can go directly to a pull request. Discuss a substantial new application, library or API change with the maintainers before implementing it; see the project's [contribution policy](https://alps.comp-phys.org/govern/contribute/). Contributions must be compatible with the [MIT License](LICENSE.txt).

## Getting started with the code

Build and install the C++ SDK with CMake, then build the Python package against it with pip. The workflow below includes applications and tests, uses one SDK installation, and requires no environment manager. Run commands from the repository root unless stated otherwise.

### Fork and clone

Fork [ALPSim/ALPS](https://github.com/ALPSim/ALPS) on GitHub, replace `<your-username>` below, and clone your fork:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ALPS.git
cd ALPS
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ALPSim/ALPS.git
```

### Prerequisites

- CMake ≥ 3.27, Ninja for the bundled presets, and C++17/C11 compilers such as GCC or Clang.
- Boost ≥ 1.76 with its compiled libraries and CMake packages, HDF5's C library, LP64 BLAS/LAPACK, and toml++ ≥ 3.4 (header-only). Use serial HDF5 for the default MPI-disabled build; see [numerical libraries](#numerical-libraries).
- For native tests (`ALPS_BUILD_TESTING=ON`): Python ≥ 3.10 for the CTest module-architecture audit; this does not require building the Python bindings.
- For Python development: GIL-enabled CPython ≥ 3.10 in a writable Python environment. Pip installs NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib with pyalps. Free-threaded Python is unsupported.
- Optional: MPI and Boost.MPI for `ALPS_ENABLE_MPI=ON`; an OpenMP runtime for `ALPS_ENABLE_OPENMP=ON`; a Fortran compiler for the Fortran examples.

Use existing dependencies or your preferred package manager. Keep the compiler, architecture and native dependency stack consistent between the SDK, bindings and downstream extensions. Older website instructions for a combined Boost.Python build do not describe this checkout.

For example, on Ubuntu 24.04:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libboost-all-dev libhdf5-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev libtomlplusplus-dev
```

On macOS, install Apple's Command Line Tools with `xcode-select --install` if needed. If you use Homebrew:

```sh
brew install boost hdf5 openblas tomlplusplus
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$(brew --prefix boost):$(brew --prefix hdf5):$(brew --prefix openblas):$(brew --prefix tomlplusplus)"
```

These are optional provider examples. For another non-system installation, set the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` environment variable to its dependency prefixes, separated by colons on Linux/macOS. Keep it set for both SDK and Python builds. The CMake command-line form instead uses semicolons: `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/prefix/one;/prefix/two"`.

### Windows users

The supported workflow for Windows users is a Linux distribution inside WSL, following the Linux instructions here. Native Windows is unsupported; its [manual CI workflow](.github/workflows/windows.yml) records experimental build commands and does not gate releases.

### Install CMake and Ninja

Check `cmake --version`, `ctest --version` and `ninja --version`. Reuse suitable tools and an existing Python environment. If you need a Python environment and build tools, one option is:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install "cmake>=3.27" ninja
```

Skip the first two lines if already using a suitable environment. On Debian/Ubuntu, creating a venv may first require `sudo apt-get install python3-venv`. Activate the same environment in each new terminal. Both CMake and CTest must be at least 3.27; use `command -v cmake` to check which installation your shell finds.

C++ library/application builds with `ALPS_BUILD_TESTING=OFF` do not require Python: system packages or [official CMake binaries](https://cmake.org/download/) and Ninja also work. Native tests require the interpreter listed above. A generator other than Ninja can be selected with a plain CMake invocation instead of a preset.

### Build

Build, test and install the shared SDK and applications:

```sh
cmake --preset default
cmake --build --preset default --parallel 2
ctest --preset default
cmake --install _build/default
export ALPS_DIR="$PWD/_build/default/install/share/alps"
export PATH="$PWD/_build/default/install/bin:$PATH"
```

The preset selects Release and installs into `_build/default/install`, without administrator privileges. `ALPS_DIR` selects that SDK for Python and downstream CMake builds; it does not replace the dependency prefixes above. Keep these exports in each development shell. Two parallel compile jobs are a conservative starting point; adjust to your available memory.

For Python development, continue in your active Python environment:

```sh
python -m pip install "scikit-build-core>=1.0" "nanobind==2.15.0" \
  "patchelf>=0.14; sys_platform == 'linux'"
CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=2 python -m pip install --no-build-isolation -e python/pyalps \
  --config-setting "build-dir=$PWD/_build/python"
python -c "import pyalps; print(pyalps.__file__)"
```

This editable installation reuses `_build/python` for binding builds. `--no-build-isolation` requires the build dependencies installed above; the nanobind pin must match the package's [build requirements](python/pyalps/pyproject.toml). The default bindings include solver modules and bundled programs, so they require a shared SDK with applications enabled, as built here. The [Python package guide](python/pyalps/README.md) covers wheels and smaller core-only builds; its `distribution` preset is an alternative SDK build, not an additional prerequisite for this workflow.

### Edit, rebuild and rerun

- **Python source:** edits take effect in a new interpreter without reinstalling.
- **SDK or application C++:** rerun the SDK build and install commands, then the editable pip command if using Python. The Python installation contains copies of native runtime files.
- **Binding C++, package resources or build configuration:** rerun the editable pip command.
- **Compiler, SDK or dependency-provider change:** reconfigure the SDK deliberately and add `--config-setting cmake.args=--fresh` to the next editable install to clear stale binding discovery. Do not reuse objects from an incompatible toolchain.

Reuse build directories for ordinary edits. Machine-specific CMake settings belong in an untracked `CMakeUserPresets.json`. For a focused native rebuild, use `cmake --build --preset default --target <target> --parallel 2`.

## Run the tests

CTest runs the native suite only. After the SDK build, run:

```sh
ctest --preset default
```

After the editable install above, test Python and installed-SDK consumers too:

```sh
python -m pip install "pytest>=8"
PYALPS_TEST_DOWNSTREAM_EXPORT=1 CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=2 \
  python -m pytest tests/pyalps tests/cmake -q -rs
```

Keep `ALPS_DIR` and any dependency prefixes set. The downstream flag enables tests that compile Python extensions against the installed SDK and pyalps runtime. These checks compile additional small projects and take longer than import tests. `tests/cmake` assumes an MPI-disabled LP64 SDK for its consumer contracts; use the default SDK for this command. If custom toolchain arguments are needed by these temporary builds, `ALPS_TEST_CMAKE_ARGS` accepts a JSON array of CMake arguments.

Read the skip reasons: MPI tests need additional MPI setup, and some wheel checks apply only to repaired distribution artifacts. A successful local run with skips does not exercise every CI configuration. For a quick iteration, select native tests with `ctest --preset default -R <pattern>` or Python tests with `python -m pytest <test-file> -q`.

For XML CLI changes, install `xsltproc` (Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install xsltproc`; Homebrew: `brew install libxslt` and add its `bin` directory to `PATH`), then run:

```sh
ALPS_XML_BUILD="$PWD/_build/default" python -m pytest tests/cli -q
```

These tests install and relocate the XML component before exercising transformations. Build/release helper changes also have tests under `tests/ci` and `tests/packaging`; release-version helpers require Python ≥ 3.11 and `packaging`. Run the tests relevant to your change, report failures or skipped coverage, and let CI validate the broader platform matrix.

## Making a change

Start from an up-to-date local `master`, then create one topic branch:

```sh
git fetch upstream
git switch master
git merge --ff-only upstream/master
git switch -c fix/alea-overflow
```

Replace `fix/alea-overflow` with your own branch name. If the fast-forward fails, resolve your local branch history before continuing; do not discard unrelated work.

Keep commits focused. Add or update tests for changed behavior; scientific changes should include a small regression against a known result. Update documentation and the Unreleased section of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for user-facing features, fixes, removals or migration steps. Internal changes without a user-facing effect do not need changelog entries.

### Code style

Match the surrounding code. Target C++17, avoid undefined behavior, and check compiler warnings. Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python. CMake changes must work with 3.27 and express usage requirements on targets with explicit `PRIVATE`, `PUBLIC` or `INTERFACE` scope. In Markdown, keep each prose paragraph on one source line while preserving code blocks, tables and list structure.

### Submitting a pull request

Commit your changes and push the current topic branch to your fork:

```sh
git push -u origin HEAD
```

Open a pull request against `ALPSim/ALPS:master`. Explain the problem, resulting behavior, tests run and any limitations using the PR template. Respond to review comments and address relevant CI failures. Review, maintenance commitments and contributor recognition follow the published [contribution policy](https://alps.comp-phys.org/govern/contribute/) and [governance](https://alps.comp-phys.org/govern/).

Sources use `src/alps/<module>/{include,src,tests}` where applicable; the broad `common/` and `runtime/` source groups are removed. First-party public headers are listed explicitly in each owner's CMake `HEADERS` file set; add new exported headers there. Public `<alps/...>` and `<ietl/...>` include names are preserved independently of physical ownership. Generated headers live in `<build-dir>/generated/include/alps/`, with templates in `cmake/config/`.

`ALPS::configuration`, `ALPS::containers`, `ALPS::numerics`, `ALPS::numeric_io` and `ALPS::solver_headers` are exported interface targets with their own header sets and declared dependencies. Foundation targets do not inherit the aggregate `ALPS::headers` interface. Numerical headers no longer depend on HDF5 or XML; archive adapters belong to `numeric_io`. The aggregate remains available for simulation modules, including the separate `expression`/`legacy_parameters` include cycle. Physical source ownership does not make every module an independent library.

MaxEnt uses `src/apps/maxent/{src,cli,tests}`; `<alps/solvers.hpp>` lives in `src/alps/solvers/include/alps/` and is exported through `ALPS::solver_headers` because it also declares CT-QMC entry points. Keep subsystem tests beside their owner and cross-module compatibility tests in `tests/integration/`. Existing CMake options and test names are preserved; moving inactive fixtures does not enable them.

`ALPS::utilities`, `ALPS::hdf5`, `ALPS::params`, `ALPS::osiris`, `ALPS::xml` and `ALPS::cli` are independently linkable libraries; `ALPS::alps` links them transitively and owns the params text/XML and older `Parameters` adapters in `src/alps/params/adapters/`. Their conversion headers live under `adapters/include/`, with unchanged public include names exposed through the aggregate interface. XML parsing/output belongs to `ALPS::xml`; file-to-parameter conversion still belongs to those adapters. `ALPS::cli` owns the unchanged `mcoptions` and `parseargs` implementations under their existing public header names.

`ALPS::params` now derives its owning dictionary/value model from ALPSCore. `ALPS::run_config` owns TOML loading and application-schema validation, with a private toml++ dependency. `ALPS::maxent` consumes resolved parameters and separate scientific data, without `ALPS::alps`; its CLI reads a TOML run file. See the [MaxEnt input guide](src/apps/maxent/README.md) and [module boundaries](src/alps/README.md). Rebuild downstream binaries after this API and checkpoint-format change.

CMake generates `alps-module-manifest.json` from module declarations and actual header/source lists. After configuration, check ownership and declared include dependencies with:

```sh
python .github/scripts/check_module_architecture.py \
  --manifest _build/default/alps-module-manifest.json \
  --write-report _build/default/alps-module-report.json
```

Update the owning module's CMake declarations when adding production files or dependencies. The checker reports existing cycles and nonliteral includes for review; it does not prove independent linkability or replace builds and scientific tests.

### Build options

| Option | Default for a top-level build | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ALPS_BUILD_TESTING` | `ON` | Build and register native ALPS tests, independently of a parent's `BUILD_TESTING` |
| `ALPS_BUILD_APPLICATIONS` | `ON` | Build simulation applications, solver libraries and command-line tools |
| `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` | `ON` when unset | Shared libraries; required for Python bindings |
| `ALPS_ENABLE_MPI` | `OFF` | Enable MPI; requires matching MPI and Boost.MPI installations |
| `ALPS_ENABLE_OPENMP` | `OFF` | Enable OpenMP, including worker scheduling |
| `ALPS_BUILD_EXTENSIVE_TESTS` | `OFF` | Add expensive graph and HDF5 type-matrix tests when testing is enabled |

For example, configure with `cmake --preset default -DALPS_ENABLE_OPENMP=ON`. The `sdk` preset disables applications and tests; `distribution` disables tests and its build preset installs automatically. When embedding ALPS with `add_subdirectory`, applications and tests default to `OFF`. MPI remains opt-in. Headers and the C++ Fortran bridge are always part of the SDK; building that bridge needs no Fortran compiler.

Examples build separately against an installed SDK; see the [C++ and Fortran example instructions](tutorials/00-examples/README.md). Fortran tutorials that call OpenMP also need a Fortran OpenMP runtime. To install tutorial sources under `share/alps/tutorials`, run `cmake --install _build/default --component tutorials` after installing the SDK.

### Numerical libraries

Both BLAS and LAPACK are required, with LP64 (32-bit) integers and lowercase symbols ending in an underscore. ILP64 and alternate symbol spellings are unsupported. `BLA_VENDOR` and `BLA_STATIC` select a provider or static numerical libraries through CMake's finders. Keep this ABI consistent when building downstream consumers; installing the SDK does not supply the external numerical libraries.

### Consuming the C++ SDK

Use the installed `ALPS_DIR` from the build instructions, or add the SDK installation prefix to `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, alongside dependency prefixes:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.27)
project(my_simulation LANGUAGES C CXX)
find_package(ALPS CONFIG REQUIRED)
add_executable(my_simulation main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_simulation PRIVATE ALPS::alps)
```

The imported target carries headers, C++17 requirements, compile definitions and transitive dependencies. Use a compiler and configuration compatible with the SDK's ABI. `ALPS::headers` exposes the compile interface without linking; `ALPS::fortran` supplies the C++ Fortran bridge and its GNU Fortran compatibility flag. Programs using only utilities can request `find_package(ALPS CONFIG REQUIRED COMPONENTS utilities)` and link `ALPS::utilities`. Archive-only programs can similarly request the `hdf5` component and link `ALPS::hdf5`, which also owns archive signal cleanup. Typed parameter programs can request the `params` component and link `ALPS::params`. XML parsing/output and command-line parsing are available through the `xml` and `cli` components and targets `ALPS::xml` and `ALPS::cli`. The parameter-file constructor and typed XML input adapter are removed. The remaining typed-to-`Parameters` bridge serves CT-INT and lattice tutorials internally through `ALPS::alps`. Package discovery still checks the SDK's complete dependency set; component-specific configuration is future work.

Use `ALPS::containers` for array storage and `ALPS::numerics` for matrix/vector algorithms and array mathematics, including the existing `<alps/multi_array.hpp>` umbrella. Numerical archive consumers link `ALPS::numeric_io` and explicitly include `<alps/hdf5/matrix.hpp>` or `<alps/hdf5/numeric_vector.hpp>`. For example:

```cmake
find_package(ALPS CONFIG REQUIRED COMPONENTS numeric_io)
target_link_libraries(my_simulation PRIVATE ALPS::numeric_io)
```

`<alps/numeric/matrix.hpp>` no longer includes its HDF5 adapter. Diagonal/deprecated matrix/vector HDF5 `save`/`load` members and matrix XML output methods, unused in this repository, were removed without compatibility adapters. These API changes are separate from the byte-preserving header moves, and no scientific algorithms were changed or imported from ALPSCore. See the [migration notes](CHANGELOG.md#removed-and-migration).

An SDK built with applications also exports executable targets such as `ALPS::spinmc` and the solver libraries `ALPS::maxent`, `ALPS::cthyb` and `ALPS::ctint`. Require them with `find_package(ALPS CONFIG REQUIRED COMPONENTS applications solvers)`. The solver API is in `<alps/solvers.hpp>`. Python extensions that share ALPS objects with pyalps use its separate [downstream CMake package](python/pyalps/README.md#downstream-native-extensions).

Installation follows `GNUInstallDirs`. Unix SDKs continue to need their external Boost, HDF5 and numerical libraries after relocation. Redistributable Python wheels need auditwheel/delocate repair, as described in the [Python runtime guide](python/pyalps/README.md#native-runtime-layout).

### XML resources and tools

Installed programs use `share/alps/xml`. CTest supplies the source resources automatically; when running an uninstalled native program directly, set `ALPS_XML_PATH` to the absolute path of `src/alps/resources/`.

Unix application builds install `alps-xml`, which requires Python 3 and `xsltproc` on `PATH`. With the SDK's `bin` directory on `PATH`, use `alps-xml --help`, or, with your own result files:

```sh
alps-xml plot text results.plot.xml
alps-xml convert html simulation.out.xml --output results.html
alps-xml extract text plot-definition.xml task*.out.xml --output measurements.txt
```

Plot/extraction formats are `text`, `html`, `gnuplot`, `matplotlib` and `grace`; conversion supports `text` and `html`. The `xml` installation component includes the command and resources.

## CI coverage

Pull requests report aggregate `Source CI` and `Packaging CI` checks. Path-based selection limits documentation-only runs; build-system and public-header changes select broader coverage. Scheduled and release runs use the full matrix. The [source workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml), [coverage matrix](.github/ci-matrix.json) and [packaging workflow](.github/workflows/build_wheels.yml) are the authoritative lists of tested configurations.

Coverage includes Linux/macOS source builds, CMake 3.27, MPI/OpenMP, installed-SDK consumers, direct CMake/editable-pip contributor workflows and repaired wheels tested on fresh runners. Dependency providers in CI are runner configuration, not requirements to use that package manager locally. Wheel builds are per CPython interpreter; local editable tests do not replace wheel and source-distribution validation.

## Preparing a release

For maintainers:

1. Review the Unreleased changelog and migration notes. Give the release section its version and date, then add a new Unreleased section.
2. Update `cmake/ALPS_VERSION.txt`, shared by the SDK and Python package, to the numeric `X.Y.Z` release version. A final tag is `vX.Y.Z`; prereleases use `vX.Y.Z-alpha.N`, `-beta.N`, `-rc.N` or `-dev.N` while the file remains `X.Y.Z`. See [versioning](python/pyalps/README.md#versioning).
3. Validate the intended tag locally with Python ≥ 3.11, replacing `vX.Y.Z` below with the actual tag:

   ```sh
   python -m pip install packaging
   python .github/scripts/check_release_version.py --ref refs/tags/vX.Y.Z
   ```

4. Merge and validate the release commit before tagging. Tag-triggered workflows validate source builds, wheels and the source distribution before the PyPI upload job. Publication also requires the repository's `pypi` environment and trusted-publisher configuration; a tag in an arbitrary fork is not sufficient. Manual validation runs do not publish.

Keep published tags fixed. If a published release is wrong, correct the source and prepare a new version; do not use `skip-existing` to conceal mismatched artifacts.
