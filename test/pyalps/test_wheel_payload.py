"""Guard what the wheel actually ships next to the extension modules.

The wheel bundles the ALPS application programs (pyalps/bin) and the ALPS
shared libraries they link against (pyalps/lib), while auditwheel/delocate
vendor the genuinely external dependencies alongside them (pyalps.libs on
Linux, pyalps/.dylibs on macOS).  Neither the ordinary binding tests nor the
wheel smoke tests ever load one of those programs, so two mistakes used to
travel undetected: shipping the same library more than once, and shipping
programs whose dynamic dependencies cannot be resolved from inside the
installed package.  These tests run after `repair-wheel-command`, so they
check the repaired artifact rather than the build tree.
