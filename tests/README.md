# Testing ALPS

Native runtime regressions use GoogleTest and CTest. During the SDK migration,
component tests remain under `test/`; shared fixtures and MPI support live in
`tests/support/`. Python tests retain their independent pytest entry point.

Configure with CMake 3.27 or newer and `ALPS_BUILD_TESTS=ON`, build the selected
targets, then run `ctest --test-dir <build-dir> --output-on-failure`.
`ALPS_BUILD_EXTENSIVE_TESTS` opts into expensive graph and HDF5 type tests;
`ALPS_ENABLE_SANITIZERS` adds AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.

GoogleTest is a test-only dependency. An installed GTest >= 1.14 is preferred;
otherwise CMake fetches the checksum-pinned 1.18.0 release. Offline builds can
set `FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_GOOGLETEST` to an existing source checkout.
Tests-disabled builds do not find or fetch GoogleTest, and it is not installed
with the SDK.

## Writing a C++ test

Create an ordinary executable, link only the component being tested, then call
`alps_add_gtest(target COMPONENT hdf5 LABELS compatibility)` from its test
CMakeLists. Each GoogleTest case is discoverable through CTest; names include
the component and executable to avoid collisions across generated type tests.
Use `TIMEOUT` for a justified nondefault limit and `THREADS` for an OpenMP test.
Group related cases in one executable when they share dependencies, labels and
resource requirements. CTest still launches each discovered case independently.
Keep separate targets for distinct MPI, stress-test or compiler requirements.
Labels describe both ownership and purpose (`compatibility`, `integration`,
`scientific`, `extensive`, `mpi`). `legacy_semantics` marks characterization of
known legacy behavior that must not constrain a replacement implementation. GoogleTest execution alone does not imply a
test is a scientific validation.

Use `alps::testing::TemporaryDirectory` for files. Cases in one executable may
run concurrently in different processes, so an executable-level working
directory is not enough to isolate filenames. Tests must not depend on ordering
or prior test output. GoogleTest assertion failures remain active in Release
builds; ordinary C `assert()` is unsuitable for test expectations.

MPI tests use `alps_add_mpi_gtest` and run as complete rank topologies. The shared
main initializes MPI, combines rank exit statuses, and writes distinct XML
reports. Every rank must enter matching collectives even after nonfatal assertion
failures. Use CTest timeouts to bound deadlocks. The rank count is also declared
as the CTest processor requirement; OpenMP and BLAS threads are bounded separately.

## Choosing assertions and reference data

Prefer direct value assertions to printed numbers. For floating-point results,
state the absolute/relative tolerance and its numerical or physical basis.
Historical decimal fixtures migrated to assertions retain their original
rounding bounds; those comparisons establish compatibility, not independent
scientific correctness. Avoid broadening a tolerance just to pass a new platform.
Floating-point equality and tolerance assertions reject NaNs; test intended
nonfinite behavior explicitly.

Combine reference values with analytic solutions, independent calculations and
invariants such as normalization or conservation. A writer/reader round trip
can hide a shared bug: retain historical files and raw-schema assertions too.
Fixture changes require provenance and a behavioral explanation in the PR.

Seed stochastic regression tests and include the seed in diagnostics. These
reproduce a particular trajectory; they do not validate uncertainty estimation
in general. New statistical validation should document the ensemble,
autocorrelation treatment, thresholds and combined false-failure probability.
Do not retry failed numerical tests until they happen to pass.

Textual serialization contracts can use `StreamFixture`: it supplies an input
fixture and compares captured output explicitly inside GoogleTest. Remaining
model/lattice serialization transcripts are retained as compatibility evidence.
They should be supplemented with semantic assertions when changing the underlying behavior.
The remaining CMake process runner is for executable/CLI/tutorial contracts.

## CI policy and evidence

Every PR runs a fixed set of checks: static/packaging helpers and numerical tutorial references, Linux serial native and editable-Python tests, Clang MPI integration, macOS SDK consumers, native ASan/UBSan, and manylinux packaging. The stable aggregate `CI` check requires every job to succeed; select it in branch protection. No workflow-level path filters can leave that required check pending.

Weekly compatibility checks cover compiler/dependency boundaries, C++20/C++23, extensive HDF5 tests, OpenMP, installed tutorials, MPI-enabled Python, Intel/newer macOS, and all three wheel families. Release tags run the same compatibility workflow, including distribution artifact validation, before publishing those exact files. Python 3.11 and 3.12 exercise distinct wheel ABIs; newer interpreters test reuse of the abi3 wheel through binding, object-lifetime and package-loading checks. Fresh-runner smoke checks cover bindings and package loading. The identical C++ SDK consumers run once per wheel platform on Python 3.12. JUnit, CTest and per-rank MPI reports remain available as workflow artifacts. See [CI coverage](../CONTRIBUTING.md#ci-coverage) for the workflow entry points.

Benchmarks remain separate from correctness gates. Existing timing programs
are not claims of performance coverage. Introduce baselines only with a defined
workload and controlled measurement environment; ordinary shared-runner wall
times are diagnostic, not reliable regression thresholds.

## Migration accounting

The migration preserves existing executable identities where possible and
expands Boost.Test typed cases into individually discovered GoogleTest cases.
Counts before and after migration are therefore not directly comparable.
Component migration notes record retained scenarios, reference provenance and
historical behavior needing a consolidation decision:

| Area | Contract and inventory |
| --- | --- |
| Numerics, containers, alea, legacy parameters, parapack | [Compatibility references](migration.md), including numerical quirks preserved for an explicit consolidation decision. |
| HDF5 | [Schema, fixtures, generated types and resource opt-ins](../src/alps/hdf5/tests/README.md). |
| Params | [Typed access, persistence and adapter contracts](../src/alps/params/tests/README.md). |
| Graph | [Canonicalization, embedding and extensive-test inventory](../src/alps/graph/tests/README.md). |
| MPI | [Rank topologies, assertions and remaining manual drivers](mpi.md). |
| Model, lattice, XML, Osiris | Basis enumeration, sign classifications, coloring/parity and decoded dump values use [semantic assertions](migration.md#model-lattice-and-osiris-semantic-assertions). Remaining XML/symbolic transcripts retain exact compatibility checks. Dump files are isolated and the historical XDR fixture remains versioned. |
| Utilities, CLI, portability and random | Direct API, wire-format, seeded sampling and platform assertions replace ad hoc mains or printed smoke output. |
| DMFT, DMRG, MaxEnt | Native regression tests use GoogleTest; executable behavior stays under CTest. MaxEnt's Python scientific oracle is shared with its binding tests. |
| Monte Carlo runners | The formerly unregistered scalar/vector examples check completion, stopping, collection and HDF5 persistence. Test counters are initialized; MPI scheduling is deterministic. |

The obsolete experimental accumulator prototype tests have been removed.
Benchmarks and remaining unregistered sources do not count toward executed coverage.

Use named skips for unavailable optional capabilities or unsupported type
combinations; skipped cases do not establish coverage. Do not add permanently
disabled tests. Any necessary quarantine must name the
reason, tracked issue and owner; CI must continue reporting the missing coverage.
