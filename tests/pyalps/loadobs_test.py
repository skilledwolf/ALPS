# Formerly loadobs.py (plus loadobs.cpp, its C++ twin). Both *read* a
# loadobs.h5 that neither of them created and that no longer ships anywhere in
# the tree, so both had been dead for years -- the Python half was additionally
# uncollectable by pytest, and the C++ half was orphaned when
# tests/pyalps/CMakeLists.txt was removed with the in-tree bindings build.
#
# The surface they meant to cover is real: walk /simulation/results in an
# archive, decide scalar vs vector from the shape of mean/value, and load each
# entry into the matching mcdata type by path. This version builds its own
# fixture from pyalps.alea, so it needs no external file and no C++ helper.
#
# It also pins down the encoding rule both originals got wrong. list_children
# returns each name exactly as stored -- already HDF5-encoded -- so it belongs
# in a path verbatim, and hdf5_name_decode is what turns it back into the
# observable's real name. Both old versions instead re-encoded what
# list_children handed them (Python via hdf5_name_encode, C++ via
# encode_segment), which double-encodes any name containing '/' or '&':
# "Energy Density / Site" became "Energy Density &#38;#47; Site" and the
# lookup missed. Their fixture evidently held only simple names.
