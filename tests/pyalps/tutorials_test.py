"""Run the pure-Python ngs tutorials as part of the wheel test suite.

tutorials/10-ngs/5_export_python is covered by build.yml, which compiles it as a
downstream CMake project. Its two pure-Python siblings needed no compiler and so
had no coverage at all -- and both were broken in ways only running them shows:
6_python_native could not store an ngs.params or its measurements dict through
`archive[path] = ...`, and neither one's load() had ever executed (one wrote to
the archive instead of reading from it, both called double()).

Running them here rather than in build.yml is deliberate: they need an installed
pyalps, which is what this suite already has, so cibuildwheel exercises them
against every wheel it builds.
